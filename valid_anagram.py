# PROBLEM: Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

# An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

# Example 1:
# Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
# Output: true

# Example 2:
# Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
# Output: false

# Date:01/11/23

# create 2 dictionaries and store the the no. of times each character has occured as values and their respective chracters as their key.
# check if the the key-value pairs are the same for both the dicts. 

class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        if len(s) != len(t):
            return False
        countS, countT = {}, {}

        for i in range(len(s)):
            countS[s[i]] = 1 + countS.get(s[i], 0)
            countT[t[i]] = 1 + countT.get(t[i], 0)
        
        for c in countS:
            if countS[c] != countT.get(c, 0):
                return False

        return True

        #OR

    # cheat trick
    # just use Counter instead of the above code, (Not preffered in interviews).
        # return Counter(s) == Counter(t)
